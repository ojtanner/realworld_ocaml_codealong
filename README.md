Code-along to the book Real World OCaml.

Commits to the repo will be sporadic.
While i feel that OCaml is a very interesting language with
very cool features, it simply is not the right language for me to learn
right now. The community is abysmally small compared to JS or Java or Python.
The libraries are (at a first glance) not mature or in active development.

I need something that tells me which library to use and how.
Not spend 2 hourse simply to find a good SQL library. *coff* *coff*
